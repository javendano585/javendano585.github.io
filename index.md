## [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/javendano585/TidyTuesday)
TidyTuesday is a weekly challenge to create a visualization representing that week's dataset. The images are shared on Twitter under #TidyTuesday.
[It's hosted by the RforDataScience community:](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

[2021 - Week 2 - Transit Cost Project](https://github.com/javendano585/TidyTuesday/tree/main/2021_Week_02)  
The one that started it all. A simple scatter plot that helped welcome me to a great community.
